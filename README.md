![A map of the 2018 Midterm Outcome](https://www.washingtonpost.com/election-results/house/)

I selected this visualization because I enjoy maps used for data purposes that are done well. Additionally, this was the first election for me that I actually wished I was able to vote in. (I was born 2 weeks before the 18 year cutoff) It is also an interactive map, which I always feel adds a certain layer of depth in any kind of graphic that is presented digitally.

I found this through the Washington Post's website, the same one I was looking at in 2018. Remembering 4 years ago, I believe it was one of the more popular sites to check this information quickly.

This visualization shows what specific districts were won by each political party during the 2018 midterm elections. It is interactive, and allows you to see the specifics of each race, seeing who each district's population voted for. It only encompasses the United States, and does not account for territories such as Puerto Rico. Overall, it displays as a large map of the United States in red and blue colors.

- **Who**: The Washington Post, using data from the Cook Political report. Specific Author not noted by the paper.
<br>
- **When**: 2018, during the November Midterms
<br>
- **Stakeholders**: All American citizens, as well as any person who has an interest in American politics or general world affairs. Also, readers of the Washington Post, for whom, this data visualization would have been linked to the front page of the paper for more than a month.
<br>
- **Interests**: Interesting how New England, even in the less populated areas leans so heavily blue, while even major cities in places like Wyoming, remain heavily red. The equal size interactive option is also an interesting way of showing data proportional to what each area is actually weighted as.
<br>
- **Key Facts**: There is a significant portion of middle America around the great plains and midwest, as well as south that leans heavily, heavily red. Similarly, most rural areas went red, which major cities like Kansas City went blue, despite the rest of the state being red.


>Data Feminism is the idea that we should work towards an ideal in thinking about data that in informed by experience, and notes that standard practice in terms of thinking about data has long reinforced existing inequalities.

As I am using the online version of this book, I do not have page numbers, but this definition is located under the *What is Data Feminism* section of the introduction. In terms of my specific visualization, I find that in some ways, showing pure population may not be the most accurate way to show voting due to the fact that in many ways it is important to show that certain groups heavily voted in a certain direction, while a general, collective means of data may serve to obscure that particular fact. :us:
